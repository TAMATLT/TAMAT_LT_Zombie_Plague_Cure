# TAMAT_LT_Zombie_Plague_Cure
7 Days to Die mod, that adds a quest to find a cure for zombie infection

## Intro

You are sent on the quest to check a rumor, that someone has managed cure zombie infection. Somewhere on the map exists a cure recipe and you need to find it. 

## Descriprion

The mod is meant to be played in winter biome, but this is completely optional. The mod scraps the usual starting quest. Instead you are given a quest to craft warm gear and right after that - a quest to find the cure.

This mod adds several ingredients. First is the grain alcohol, previously removed from the game and the cure itself. The cure recipe must be located first. It can be found almost everywhere: cars, hidden stashes, zombie loot and medcial crates. But it is a rare find. You will also need to craft chemistry station to make cure.

Once 20 doses of the cure are crafted you have won the challenge.
